Django 5.2.7 release notes
==========================

*October 1, 2025*

Django 5.2.7 fixes one security issue with severity "high", one security issue
with severity "low", and one bug in 5.2.6. Also, the latest string translations
from Transifex are incorporated.

CVE-2025-59681: Potential SQL injection in ``QuerySet.annotate()``, ``alias()``, ``aggregate()``, and ``extra()`` on MySQL and MariaDB
======================================================================================================================================

:meth:`.QuerySet.annotate`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.alias`,
:meth:`~.QuerySet.aggregate`, and :meth:`~.QuerySet.extra` methods were subject
to SQL injection in column aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with
dictionary expansion, as the ``**kwargs`` passed to these methods (follow up to
:cve:`2022-28346`).

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that reduced the color contrast of
  the chosen label of ``filter_horizontal`` and ``filter_vertical`` widgets
  within a ``TabularInline`` (:ticket:`36601`).

*October 1, 2025*

Django 5.1.13 fixes one security issue with severity "high" and one security

CVE-2025-59681: Potential SQL injection in ``QuerySet.annotate()``, ``alias()``, ``aggregate()``, and ``extra()`` on MySQL and MariaDB
======================================================================================================================================

:meth:`.QuerySet.annotate`, :meth:`~.QuerySet.alias`,
:meth:`~.QuerySet.aggregate`, and :meth:`~.QuerySet.extra` methods were subject
to SQL injection in column aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with
dictionary expansion, as the ``**kwargs`` passed to these methods (follow up to
:cve:`2022-28346`).
